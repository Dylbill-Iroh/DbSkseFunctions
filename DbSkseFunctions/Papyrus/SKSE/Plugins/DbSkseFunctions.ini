;Game Time Timers use polling so that they catch when waiting or sleeping, or when the gameHour global variable is changed.
;This sets the polling interval in real time seconds. Default is 1.5 seconds.
;Polling with SKSE doesn't affect performance too much.
;I tested running over 100 game time timers running at once with no fps loss.
gameTimerPollingInterval=1.5

;this is for the GetRecentHitArrowRefs and GetRecentShotArrowRefs functions in DbSkseFunctions.psc 
;Sets the maximum amount of arrows / bolts tracked and saved for each actor or target reference
