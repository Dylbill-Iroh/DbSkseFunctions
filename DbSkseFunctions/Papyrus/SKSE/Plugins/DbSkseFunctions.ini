;Game Time Timers use polling so that they catch when waiting or sleeping, or when the gameHour global variable is changed.
;This sets the polling interval in real time seconds. Default is 1.5 seconds.
;Polling with SKSE doesn't affect performance too much.
;I tested running over 100 game time timers running at once with no fps loss.
gameTimerPollingInterval=1.5

;this is for tracking projectiles. Required for the OnProjectileImpactGlobal event and GetRecentProjectile functions in DbSkseFunctions.psc
;Sets the maximum amount of arrows / bolts tracked and saved for each actor or target reference
;Set to 0 to disable tracking projectiles all together (default)
;Set to around 5 to 10 to make active
iMaxArrowsSavedPerReference=0

;The activate event sink is necessary to track the last player activated reference. 
;It's used for the DbSkseFunctions.GetLastPlayerActivatedRef() and DbSkseFunctions.GetLastPlayerMenuActivatedRef() functions. 
;Set to 0 to disable by default, or 1 to enable by default.
;The event can still become enabled if a script registers for the OnActivateGlobal event, but if this setting is 0 player actived refs aren't tracked.
bActivateEventSinkEnabledByDefault=1

;The MenuOpenClose event sink is necessary for the DbSkseFunctions.GetLastPlayerMenuActivatedRef() function
;and for other menu functions such as DbSkseFunctions.GetLastMenuOpened()
;It's also necessary for updating timers. If a script uses StartTimer() or StartMenuModeTimer() ect this event sink must be enabled for it to work.
;Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable.
